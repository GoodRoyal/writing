every thought could be tracked. 
when thoughts were bundled that was tracked too.
free thinkers then
used this method:
create an attractive thought net
give it energy and attention
and maintain various tangents in view
but not in thought

so our hero on Friday looked at a bamboo stalks
not thinking about penetration

opposite to our hero the bamboo stalk stalked
it knew something was up
and it knew it was penetration.

question: can an athlete win and loose a race at the same time?
better, how does silicon process koans?

koan: why penetrate what is whole?
better, who penetrates the whole?
better, why/what/how/who/where/when-ideterminate....action/nonaction....objectt/nonobject
objective; thought monitoring architecture
purpose: better 61 outcomes, red team.

in a crypt the sith lives through putrefaction
net net experiencing putrefaction trumps buddhahood

lingering on putrefaction, are you?
nah
just a thought
when I close my eyes
attention takes me to the crypt where the sith lord sits putrefying and I hang out until I grow bored
ah, jumping...
ah, not jumping....
light unity is one. shades are infinite. way past suffering there are processes that teach, detached from learning one wonders in and out at will, light accepted and desired at any point as an end, more of a curious wonder before extinction trip.

watched a movie thinking all of these were best takes and digged the actors
the plot irrelevant except for what doesn't make sense
    whys this dude so tortured about shit
    whys this politician with a bad boy throwing washing machines at car
    why doesn't the oriental boss, great face, shoot the dude responsible
Im looking at reality as a director and at movies as a director and know
the importance of strong bones. with strong bones i can zero out.
