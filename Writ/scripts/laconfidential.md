        OVER the opening strains of "I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA," a 
        MONTAGE:  a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and 
        live action.  Economy Booming!  Postwar Optimism!  L.A.: 
        City of the Future!  But most prominent among them: 
        GANGLAND!  Police photographers document crime scenes. 
        The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue.  Where 
        will it end? 
 
 
        EXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET 
 
        Palm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky.  City 
        lights twinkle.  Los Angeles.  A place where anything is 
        possible.  A place where dreams come true.  As the sky 
        darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and 
        forth.
